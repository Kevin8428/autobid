# autobid

#####Autobid will allow a user to post 'projects' detailing repairs needed to be done to a car. Mechanics will then be able to bid on the project. Currently there are 3 tables: projects, accounts and comments. Mechanics can bid using the comments  table, which has FKs for accounts and projects.
